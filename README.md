#AndroidProjects

Hey folks 🙋‍♂️

Welcome to my Android repo.

Basically I am documenting my whole android journey here and maintaining records of all the concepts that I have learned.

This way I'd be able to fulfil the "learn in public" initiative which is initiated by various folks in this tech community.

Shoutout to them for spreading awareness regarding the same.
